          <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Katie Amberg-Johnson</strong>.</h1>

        <p>I am a biologist interested in developing therapeutics that improve human health.</p>

        <p>My scientific career started as an undergraduate in <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/wemmer/home.html">David Wemmer’s lab</a> at UC Berkeley, where I used single-molecule optical tweezers and NMR to study the force-dependent molecular mechanisms of the bacterial transcription factor, sigma54. As a young scientist, I became hooked on the endless and diverse ways in which cells sense and regulate themselves and their environment.</p>

        <p>I received my Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology from Stanford University for work in <a href="https://yehlab.stanford.edu/">Ellen Yeh’s lab</a>. There I focused on identifying novel antimalarials that target the malaria parasite’s unusual and mysterious apicoplast organelle. This opportunity merged my desires to study noncanonical biology and promote human health. Towards the end of graduate school, I interned at <a href="https://insightfellows.com/data-science">Insight Data Science</a> to further develop my computational skills, developing algorithms to predict bacterial contamination in ocean water. As someone who grew up in Hawaii, this topic was close to my heart.</p>

        <p>I now live in New York City and work at <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/inzen-therapeutics">Inzen Therapeutics</a>, a biotech startup focused on developing drugs that manipulate cell death. Cell death occurs continually in the human body as a result of both normal and diseased states and leads to the release of specific biomolecules, many of which may signal to their surrounding environment. Cell signaling is poorly understood and a rich source of drug targets. At Inzen, we are uncovering these novel signaling factors released by dying and stressed cells and leveraging them to cure and treat disease.</p>
